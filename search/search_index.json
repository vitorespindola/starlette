It is production-ready, and gives you the following: Seriously impressive performance. WebSocket support. GraphQL support. In-process background tasks. Startup and shutdown events. Test client built on requests . CORS, GZip, Static Files, Streaming responses. Session and Cookie support. 100% test coverage. 100% type annotated codebase. Zero hard dependencies. Requirements Python 3.6+ Installation $ pip3 install starlette You'll also want to install an ASGI server, such as uvicorn , daphne , or hypercorn . $ pip3 install uvicorn Example from starlette.applications import Starlette from starlette.responses import JSONResponse import uvicorn app = Starlette ( debug = True ) @app.route ( '/' ) async def homepage ( request ): return JSONResponse ({ 'hello' : 'world' }) if __name__ == '__main__' : uvicorn . run ( app , host = '0.0.0.0' , port = 8000 ) For a more complete example, see here . Dependencies Starlette does not have any hard dependencies, but the following are optional: requests - Required if you want to use the TestClient . aiofiles - Required if you want to use FileResponse or StaticFiles . jinja2 - Required if you want to use Jinja2Templates . python-multipart - Required if you want to support form parsing, with request.form() . itsdangerous - Required for SessionMiddleware support. pyyaml - Required for SchemaGenerator support. graphene - Required for GraphQLApp support. ujson - Required if you want to use UJSONResponse . You can install all of these with pip3 install starlette[full] . Framework or Toolkit Starlette is designed to be used either as a complete framework, or as an ASGI toolkit. You can use any of its components independently. from starlette.responses import PlainTextResponse async def app ( scope , receive , send ): assert scope [ 'type' ] == 'http' response = PlainTextResponse ( 'Hello, world!' ) await response ( scope , receive , send ) Run the app application in example.py : $ uvicorn example:app INFO: Started server process [ 11509 ] INFO: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 ( Press CTRL+C to quit ) Run uvicorn with --reload to enable auto-reloading on code changes. Modularity The modularity that Starlette is designed on promotes building re-usable components that can be shared between any ASGI framework. This should enable an ecosystem of shared middleware and mountable applications. The clean API separation also means it's easier to understand each component in isolation. Performance Independent TechEmpower benchmarks show Starlette applications running under Uvicorn as one of the fastest Python frameworks available . (*) For high throughput loads you should: Make sure to install ujson and use UJSONResponse . Run using Gunicorn using the uvicorn worker class. Use one or two workers per-CPU core. (You might need to experiment with this.) Disable access logging. For example: gunicorn -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker --log-level warning example:app Several of the ASGI servers also have pure Python implementations available, so you can also run under PyPy if your application code has parts that are CPU constrained. Either programatically: uvicorn . run ( ... , http = 'h11' , loop = 'asyncio' ) Or using Gunicorn: gunicorn -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornH11Worker ... \u2014 \u2b50\ufe0f \u2014 Starlette is BSD licensed code.

Adding routes to the application You can use any of the following to add handled routes to the application: app.add_route(path, func, methods=[\"GET\"]) - Add an HTTP route. The function may be either a coroutine or a regular function, with a signature like func(request, **kwargs) -> response . app.add_websocket_route(path, func) - Add a websocket session route. The function must be a coroutine, with a signature like func(session, **kwargs) . @app.route(path) - Add an HTTP route, decorator style. @app.websocket_route(path) - Add a WebSocket route, decorator style. Adding event handlers to the application There are two ways to add event handlers: @app.on_event(event_type) - Add an event, decorator style app.add_event_handler(event_type, func) - Add an event through a function call. event_type must be specified as either 'startup' or 'shutdown' . Submounting other applications Submounting applications is a powerful way to include reusable ASGI applications. app.mount(prefix, app) - Include an ASGI app, mounted under the given path prefix Customizing exception handling You can use either of the following to catch and handle particular types of exceptions that occur within the application: app.add_exception_handler(exc_class_or_status_code, handler) - Add an error handler. The handler function may be either a coroutine or a regular function, with a signature like func(request, exc) -> response . @app.exception_handler(exc_class_or_status_code) - Add an error handler, decorator style. app.debug - Enable or disable error tracebacks in the browser.

It will be removed in a future release. The legacy documentation is available here .

These are all implemented as standard ASGI middleware classes, and can be applied either to Starlette or to any other ASGI application. The Starlette application class allows you to include the ASGI middleware in a way that ensures that it remains wrapped by the exception handler. from starlette.applications import Starlette from starlette.middleware.httpsredirect import HTTPSRedirectMiddleware from starlette.middleware.trustedhost import TrustedHostMiddleware app = Starlette () # Ensure that all requests include an 'example.com' or '*.example.com' host header, # and strictly enforce https-only access. app . add_middleware ( TrustedHostMiddleware , allowed_hosts = [ 'example.com' , '*.example.com' ]) app . add_middleware ( HTTPSRedirectMiddleware ) Starlette also allows you to add middleware functions, using a decorator syntax: @app.middleware ( \"http\" ) async def add_custom_header ( request , call_next ): response = await call_next ( request ) response . headers [ 'Custom' ] = 'Example' return response The following middleware implementations are available in the Starlette package: CORSMiddleware Adds appropriate CORS headers to outgoing responses in order to allow cross-origin requests from browsers. The default parameters used by the CORSMiddleware implementation are restrictive by default, so you'll need to explicitly enable particular origins, methods, or headers, in order for browsers to be permitted to use them in a Cross-Domain context. from starlette.applications import Starlette from starlette.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware app = Starlette () app . add_middleware ( CORSMiddleware , allow_origins = [ '*' ]) The following arguments are supported: allow_origins - A list of origins that should be permitted to make cross-origin requests. eg. ['https://example.org', 'https://www.example.org'] . You can use ['*'] to allow any origin. allow_origin_regex - A regex string to match against origins that should be permitted to make cross-origin requests. eg. 'https://.*\\.example\\.org' . allow_methods - A list of HTTP methods that should be allowed for cross-origin requests. Defaults to ['GET'] . You can use ['*'] to allow all standard methods. allow_headers - A list of HTTP request headers that should be supported for cross-origin requests. Defaults to [] . You can use ['*'] to allow all headers. The Accept , Accept-Language , Content-Language and Content-Type headers are always allowed for CORS requests. allow_credentials - Indicate that cookies should be supported for cross-origin requests. Defaults to False . expose_headers - Indicate any response headers that should be made accessible to the browser. Defaults to [] . max_age - Sets a maximum time in seconds for browsers to cache CORS responses. Defaults to 60 . The middleware responds to two particular types of HTTP request... CORS preflight requests These are any OPTION request with Origin and Access-Control-Request-Method headers. In this case the middleware will intercept the incoming request and respond with appropriate CORS headers, and either a 200 or 400 response for informational purposes. Simple requests Any request with an Origin header. In this case the middleware will pass the request through as normal, but will include appropriate CORS headers on the response. SessionMiddleware Adds signed cookie-based HTTP sessions. Session information is readable but not modifiable. Access or modify the session data using the request.session dictionary interface. The following arguments are supported: secret_key - Should be a random string. session_cookie - Defaults to \"session\". max_age - Session expiry time in seconds. Defaults to 2 weeks. same_site - SameSite flag prevents the browser from sending session cookie along with cross-site requests. Defaults to 'lax' . https_only - Indicate that Secure flag should be set (can be used with HTTPS only). Defaults to False . HTTPSRedirectMiddleware Enforces that all incoming requests must either be https or wss . Any incoming requests to http or ws will be redirected to the secure scheme instead. from starlette.applications import Starlette from starlette.middleware.httpsredirect import HTTPSRedirectMiddleware app = Starlette () app . add_middleware ( HTTPSRedirectMiddleware ) There are no configuration options for this middleware class. TrustedHostMiddleware Enforces that all incoming requests have a correctly set Host header, in order to guard against HTTP Host Header attacks. from starlette.applications import Starlette from starlette.middleware.trustedhost import TrustedHostMiddleware app = Starlette () app . add_middleware ( TrustedHostMiddleware , allowed_hosts = [ 'example.com' , '*.example.com' ]) The following arguments are supported: allowed_hosts - A list of domain names that should be allowed as hostnames. Wildcard domains such as *.example.com are supported for matching subdomains. To allow any hostname either use allowed_hosts=[\"*\"] or omit the middleware. If an incoming request does not validate correctly then a 400 response will be sent. GZipMiddleware Handles GZip responses for any request that includes \"gzip\" in the Accept-Encoding header. The middleware will handle both standard and streaming responses. from starlette.applications import Starlette from starlette.middleware.gzip import GZipMiddleware app = Starlette () app . add_middleware ( GZipMiddleware , minimum_size = 1000 ) The following arguments are supported: minimum_size - Do not GZip responses that are smaller than this minimum size in bytes. Defaults to 500 . BaseHTTPMiddleware An abstract class that allows you to write ASGI middleware against a request/response interface, rather than dealing with ASGI messages directly. To implement a middleware class using BaseHTTPMiddleware , you must override the async def dispatch(request, call_next) method. class CustomHeaderMiddleware ( BaseHTTPMiddleware ): async def dispatch ( self , request , call_next ): response = await call_next ( request ) response . headers [ 'Custom' ] = 'Example' return response app = Starlette () app . add_middleware ( CustomHeaderMiddleware ) If you want to provide configuration options to the middleware class you should override the __init__ method, ensuring that the first argument is app , and any remaining arguments are optional keyword arguments. Make sure to set the app attribute on the instance if you do this. class CustomHeaderMiddleware ( BaseHTTPMiddleware ): def __init__ ( self , app , header_value = 'Example' ): self . app = app self . header_value = header_value async def dispatch ( self , request , call_next ): response = await call_next ( request ) response . headers [ 'Custom' ] = self . header_value return response app = Starlette () app . add_middleware ( CustomHeaderMiddleware , header_value = 'Customized' ) Middleware classes should not modify their state outside of the __init__ method. Instead you should keep any state local to the dispatch method, or pass it around explicitly, rather than mutating the middleware instance. Using middleware in other frameworks To wrap ASGI middleware around other ASGI applications, you should use the more general pattern of wrapping the application instance: app = TrustedHostMiddleware ( app , allowed_hosts = [ 'example.com' ]) You can do this with a Starlette application instance too, but it is preferable to use .add_middleware , as it'll ensure that you don't lose the reference to the application object, and that the exception handling always wraps around any other behaviour. Third party middleware SentryMiddleware A middleware class for logging exceptions to Sentry . ProxyHeadersMiddleware Uvicorn includes a middleware class for determining the client IP address, when proxy servers are being used, based on the X-Forwarded-Proto and X-Forwarded-For headers. For more complex proxy configurations, you might want to adapt this middleware. TimingMiddleware A middleware class to emit timing information (cpu and wall time) for each request which passes through it. Includes examples for how to emit these timings as statsd metrics. datasette-auth-github This middleware adds authentication to any ASGI application, requiring users to sign in using their GitHub account (via OAuth ). Access can be restricted to specific users or to members of specific GitHub organizations or teams.

The URL instance is a string-like object. app.url_path_for() Applications now support URL path reversing with app.url_path_for(name, **path_params) . This method returns a URL instance with the path and scheme set. The URL instance is a string-like object, and will return only the path if coerced to a string. app.routes Applications now support a .routes parameter, which returns a list of [Route|WebSocketRoute|Mount] .

For instance: request['path'] will return the ASGI path. If you don't need to access the request body you can instantiate a request without providing an argument to receive . Method The request method is accessed as request.method . URL The request URL is accessed as request.url . The property is a string-like object that exposes all the components that can be parsed out of the URL. For example: request.url.path , request.url.port , request.url.scheme . Headers Headers are exposed as an immutable, case-insensitive, multi-dict. For example: request.headers['content-type'] Query Parameters Query parameters are exposed as an immutable multi-dict. For example: request.query_params['search'] Path Parameters Router path parameters are exposed as a dictionary interface.

You can use any of requests standard API, such as authentication, session cookies handling, or file uploads. By default the TestClient will raise any exceptions that occur in the application. Occasionally you might want to test the content of 500 error responses, rather than allowing client to raise the server exception. In this case you should use client = TestClient(app, raise_server_exceptions=False) . Testing WebSocket sessions You can also test websocket sessions with the test client.
